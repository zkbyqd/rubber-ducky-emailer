# Rubber Ducky E-Mailer
> Project for Uni Subject "Hardware-Security"

## Task
Research the hacking tool Rubber Ducky. Use a suitable device of your choice, e.g., Arduino, to implement a Rubber Ducky attack on a target system. The Rubber Ducky should be connected via USB by the user to the target system. Afterwards, the Rubber Ducky should send emails from the target system to any recipient. The email should contain information such as the IP address, the operating system + version, and the username of the compromised user.
Describe the technical background of your Rubber Ducky and the procedure for attacking systems. Consider how this type of attack could be used to target systems of any chosen victim.
